# 🐱 DeskyMate

A cute animated **desktop pet for Windows** built with Python.

DeskyMate lives on your desktop, walks around randomly, reacts to clicks, performs idle animations, and sometimes follows your mouse cursor.

The project uses **sprite animation + Tkinter** to create a lightweight desktop companion.

## 🧠 How It Works

The project uses:

* **Tkinter** → transparent always-on-top window
* **Pillow (PIL)** → image loading and scaling
* **pynput** → track mouse and keyboard activity
* **Sprite animations** → idle and sleep states

The pet behavior system includes:

* Idle animation
* Sleep detection
* Random movement
* Cursor tracking
* Interaction reactions

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Planned features:

* 🐾 Real walking animation
* 🍗 Feeding system
* 💬 Speech bubbles
* 🪑 Sitting on the Windows taskbar
* 🎮 Game detection
